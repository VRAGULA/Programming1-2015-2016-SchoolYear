**Mystery Idea**
  In this project idea, the user is a modern day detective. He/she receives emails in his inbox, which outlines an incident he/she must investigate. Through the email, the user is allowed to visit certain places where he/she can get clues and solve the mystery. He/she is allowed to hack into servers to acquire information. He/she can send emails to two other experts for help on a certain thing and in order to make the official arrest, must send an email to the police outlining who committed the murder and why.
  
  
**Controls**
  The controls for this game include traveling to different places, sending emails, hacking into servers to download information, finding clues, unearthing evidence, both incriminating and useless.
